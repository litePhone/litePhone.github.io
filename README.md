# Labs
[Lab 1](/Lab1) 
Introduction lab; the transitional lab from Computer Hardware to Computer Architecture. Introduces the use of GSM AT commands and a refresher on communication with Espressif Systems and Arduino style 32-bit MCU.

[Lab 2](/Lab2)
The **TFT\_eSPI** library is a widely adopted tool in the embedded systems world, especially among developers working with 32-bit microcontrollers like the **ESP32**. This lab will introduce you to core concepts in UI rendering, event-driven design, and SPI-based hardware control. You will also use **EEZ Studio**, a modern UI prototyping environment, and **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)** to design interactive components.

[Lab 3](/Lab3)
Learn how to use simple Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software to design and FDM print a simple enclosure for your litePhone.

[Lab 4](/Lab4)
Learn how to utilize Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software like EasyEDA to design your custom PCB and use JLCPCB’s SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) manufacturing service to fabricate your board.

[Lab 5](/Lab5)
Learn how to create a streamlined, low distraction User Interface (UI) using the TFT_eSPI library and EEZ Studio, designed specifically for making phone calls with your ESP32-based litePhone.

[Lab 6](/Lab6)
Create a functional text-messaging interface and a utilities application of your choosing for your ESP32-based litePhone using EEZ Studio and the TFT_eSPI library.
