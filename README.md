## [🔧 Lab 1 – Microcontroller Fundamentals](/Lab1)
Introduction to the transition from Computer Hardware to Computer Architecture. Gain hands-on experience with GSM AT commands and communication protocols for Espressif Systems and Arduino-compatible 32-bit MCUs.

## [🎨 Lab 2 – UI Development & Graphics](/Lab2)
Master embedded UI rendering using **TFT_eSPI**, a widely-adopted library for 32-bit microcontrollers like the **ESP32**. Learn event-driven design, SPI hardware control, and modern UI prototyping with **EEZ Studio** and **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)**.

## [🖨️ Lab 3 – 3D Design & Manufacturing](/Lab3)
Explore CAD/CAM software to design and FDM 3D-print a custom enclosure for your litePhone. Gain practical experience in mechanical design and rapid prototyping.

## [📐 Lab 4 – PCB Design & Fabrication](/Lab4)
Learn Electronic Design Automation (EDA) using **EasyEDA** to design custom PCBs. Leverage JLCPCB's SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) service to bring your designs to life.

## [📱 Lab 5 – Phone Call Interface](/Lab5)
Build a streamlined, distraction-free calling interface using **TFT_eSPI** and **EEZ Studio**, optimized specifically for voice communication on your ESP32-based litePhone.

## [💬 Lab 6 – Messaging & Utilities](/Lab6)
Create a functional text-messaging interface and develop a custom utilities application of your choice using **EEZ Studio** and the **TFT_eSPI** library.
