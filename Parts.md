Below are the parts that you will need to complete all 6 labs.

The labs were constructed around the following parts photos are included as the part name does not describe the full pinout and breakout board attached to the parts.

**LTE Modem** – SIMCOM A7670G-LABE with Breakout

Requirements: Must Have SMS and Voice Capability and Must Have SPK+, SPK-, MIC+, MIC- pinout

Best places to look are AliExpress or Alibaba EBay and Amazon may have similar.

The G at the end is important aswell as it signifies Global Band compatibility.

I recommend one with the pins already soldered translation is a little poor so they may call it ‘With Welding’

Display

ILI9341 with XPT2046 Touch Controller is recommended as it is what I provide the code for

Microcontroller

The labs are built around the ESP32-S3 Devkit with 44 Pins

Make sure to get one with pre-soldered pins to make your life easier.

Microphone & Speaker

Any 8 Ohm 0.5W speaker should do the trick

This speaker should work as it has DuPont connector available

Any microphone should work this may be better as it has a built in amplifier if it does not snip the microphone off and use it as is

Charging (Optional)

If you would like to add charging to your project you can use a LX-LCBST module

It is cheap and doesn’t not support Fast Chargers but it gets the job done

I recommend usage of a 1000mah Battery

This will require soldering
