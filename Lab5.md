Learn how to create a streamlined, low distraction User Interface (UI) using the TFT\_eSPI library and EEZ Studio, designed specifically for making phone calls with your ESP32-based litePhone.

Objective:

Gain practical experience designing an intuitive, minimalist UI tailored for communication tasks on embedded hardware. This lab emphasizes simplicity and usability, crucial for developing efficient and focused embedded system applications.

## Part 1 – UI Design in EEZ Studio

___

Use EEZ Studio and the TFT\_eSPI library to design and implement a low-distraction UI for initiating and managing phone calls.

Requirements:

Your UI must:

-   Display a clear, simple numeric keypad for dialing
-   Show incoming call notifications clearly
-   Include intuitive controls for call acceptance, rejection, and termination
-   Minimize on-screen distractions and animations to ensure clarity and focus
-   Match the resolution and capabilities of your TFT display

> 🏆 Challenge
> 
> Explore principles of minimalist UI design. Implement techniques such as reduced color palettes or simplified button layouts to enhance usability. Document your design choices clearly.

## Part 2 – TFT\_eSPI Integration and Coding

___

Steps:

-   Implement functionality:
    -   Dialing interface
    -   Call handling logic (accept, reject, hang up)
    -   GSM module (e.g., A7670G) integration for making and receiving calls
-   Optimize the UI refresh and interaction speed to ensure responsive behavior

> 🏆 Challenge
> 
> Test and optimize touch sensitivity and response times. Aim for seamless interaction to ensure intuitive call management. Document any specific optimizations or issues encountered.

## Part 3 – Integration and Testing

___

After implementing your UI:

-   Test UI functionality extensively with live GSM calls
-   Evaluate responsiveness, intuitiveness, and overall user experience
-   Identify usability issues and iterate the UI accordingly

Submit the following:

-   EEZ Studio project files
-   Source code implementing TFT\_eSPI UI
-   Photos or short video demonstrating:
    -   Dialing a call
    -   Receiving and managing incoming calls
    -   Overall UI functionality
-   Short report (1–2 pages) including:
    -   Overview of your UI design approach
    -   Specific choices made to minimize distractions
    -   Iterations, revisions, and rationale for changes
    -   Lessons learned
